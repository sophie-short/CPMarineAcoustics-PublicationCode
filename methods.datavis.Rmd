## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
methods <- data.frame(deployment = c("Fall 2022", "Winter 2023", "Summer 2023"),start = c("26 Sept", "1 Feb", "22 May"),end = c("3 Oct", "23 Mar", "21 Jul"), coordinates= c("35.11631N 120.79067W", "35.11340N 120.78890W", "35.14784N 120.842194W"), depth= c("50", "58", "56"))
view(methods)


  

```
```{r}
install.packages(devtools)
```
```{r}

```
